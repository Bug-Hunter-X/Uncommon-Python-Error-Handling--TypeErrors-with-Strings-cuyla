This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating an uncommon error handling scenario. The code showcases how to gracefully handle ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions, providing specific error messages for different situations.  The main focus is on correctly handling TypeErrors when one or both operands are strings, differentiating this error from other TypeErrors.
